assert add(1, 2) == 4 # output: -1

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input list of words is empty. The issue arises because the code does not handle the case where there are no words to process. As a result, it still appends a line with spaces to the result list, even when there are no words. To fix this issue, we should add a condition at the beginning of the function to check if the input list is empty, and return an empty list if it is. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for empty input lists.

[self-reflection]:
The implementation failed the where no subarray fulfills the condition. The issue in the implementation is due to the use of >= instead of > in the condition to update the result. Because of this, it returns a subarray even when the sum is greater than the target, as it still updates the result when the current subarray length is equal to the previous longest subarray length. To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length. This can be done by replacing >= with > in the condition.

[self-reflection]:
The implementation failed 4 out of the 7 test cases due to an IndexError. The issue stems from the while loop while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:, which directly accesses nums[right] without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError.
